### Bali Document Repository
This project provides a JavaScript version of the document repository classes for the [_Bali Nebulaâ„¢_](https://github.com/craterdog-bali/bali-project-documentation/wiki). It defines the interface to the document repository and the following implementations of that interface:
 * **LocalRepository** - This implementation uses the local filesystem as the repository and is only for testing.
 * **RemoteRepository** - This implementation uses a remote repository service and accesses it via HTTPS.
 * **S3Repository** - This implementation uses the AWS S3 filesystem as the repository and is only accessible with the proper AWS credentials.

_**WARNING**_
_This project is still in its early stages and the classes and interfaces to the classes are likely to change._
